## Traffic Light FSM (Finite State Machine) Simulation
This project simulates a traffic light system using a Finite State Machine (FSM) written in C++. It includes an interface built with Python to simulate emergency overrides, mimicking UART communication for embedded system testing.

## Features

- Simulates North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) traffic lights with timed transitions.
- Emergency mode (all directions red) triggered by Python script.
- Manual test interface using simulated UART via Python.

## How to Build and Run (C++ FSM)

### Prerequisites
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- A C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW or g++)
- Python 3.x (for the UART interface)

---

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Prat30-A/TrafficLightFSM.git
cd TrafficLightFSM

# Create and enter the build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Run CMake and build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

# Run the FSM executable
./traffic_fsm.exe
### Run the Python Interface
cd interface
python control.py
- You’ll be prompted to enter 1 (to simulate emergency) or 0 (normal mode).
- This writes to ../data/input.txt, which the FSM reads.

```

### FSM Logic
- The FSM has five states:

- NS_Green

- NS_Yellow

- EW_Green

- EW_Yellow

- Emergency

### Each state transitions with a delay:

- Green: 5 seconds

- Yellow: 2 seconds

- Emergency: 4 seconds (all directions red)

- The Python script triggers the Emergency state by writing 1 to data/input.txt.
